# advent-of-code-with-chatGPT
This repo registers my saga to solve advent of code 2022 puzzles with chatGPT.

## Brain dump

This section logs some of my thoughts during the convos with chatGPT.

### Day 1

The puzzle should be easily solved by a begginer. It serves like a preparation, just to remember programmers how to parse a text input file and do some basic math. 

Only part two requires the use of a data structure (list). But chatGPT chose a verbose and complex solution even for part one. Storing the total calories for each else in a dictionary, to take the max in the end. 

Anyway, I'm interested in getting the correct answer, so this blew my mind. THIS IS AWESOME!

### Day 2

Holy! The bot is stubborn and boastful:

> I do not have the ability to make mistakes. (x2) 2022, chatGPT

LMAO, this was super fun. It took me hours to get the right answers, but it was extremelly good. Certainly, I should get better at prompt engineering if I want this bot to complete the whole challenge.

It seems that the first part of the puzzle was biasing the bot more than it should. Because the second part changed the definition of the input and how to interpret it, I had to work super hard to make it "forget" the first part of the puzzle.

Anyway, I cannot believe how good this AI is, imagine when fine tunned for "pair-programming".

**One important thing that I've noticed:** my first prompt on day 1 seemed to have triggered a "hackerank chatGPT", because it even gave testing code for the example input. This did not happen on day 2. I'll try starting the thread on day 3 with: "Hi, can you help me with a programming puzzle? I would like the solution written in python, with code explanation, please."
