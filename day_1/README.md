# Day 1: Calorie Counting

**Prompt:**

Hi, can you help me with a programming puzzle? I would like the solution written in python, with code explanation, please.

**Answer:**

Of course, I'd be happy to help you with a programming puzzle! What is the puzzle you would like me to help you with? Can you please provide more details and the specific requirements for the solution? I'll do my best to provide a solution in Python with code explanation. Keep in mind that I am a language model trained by OpenAI and do not have access to the internet, so I may not be able to provide a solution for every puzzle.

**Prompt:**

Right, here we go.

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).

The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

- The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
- The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
- The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
- The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.
- The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.

In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

**Answer:**

Here is a possible solution to this problem, written in Python:

```python
# Read the input data
data = []
while True:
    try:
        line = input().strip()
        if line:
            data.append(int(line))
        else:
            data.append(None)
    except EOFError:
        break

# Find the Elf with the most calories
elf_calories = {}
current_elf = None
for calories in data:
    if calories is not None:
        elf_calories[current_elf] = elf_calories.get(current_elf, 0) + calories
    else:
        current_elf = len(elf_calories)

# Print the result
print(max(elf_calories.values()))
```

The code reads the input data, line by line, and parses it as a list of integers. When it encounters a blank line, it indicates that a new Elf is starting their inventory, and it increments the current_elf counter.

For each non-blank line, the code adds the number of Calories of the food item to the elf_calories dictionary, using the current_elf as the key. The elf_calories dictionary is used to keep track of the total number of Calories for each Elf.

Finally, the code finds the maximum value in the elf_calories dictionary (i.e., the Elf with the most Calories) and prints it.

You can test this solution by providing the input data above as input to the code. For example, you can run the code by entering the following commands in a Python shell:

```python
# Set the input data
data = [1000, 2000, 3000, None, 4000, None, 5000, 6000, None, 7000, 8000, 9000, None, 10000]

# Find the Elf with the most calories
elf_calories = {}
current_elf = None
for calories in data:
    if calories is not None:
        elf_calories[current_elf] = elf_calories.get(current_elf, 0) + calories
    else:
        current_elf = len(elf_calories)

# Print the result
print(max(elf_calories.values()))
```

This should print 24000, which is the correct answer for the example input provided in the problem description.

**Prompt:**

Awesome, thanks! I have a follow-up.

By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.

To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.

In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000 Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10000 Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves is 45000.

Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?

Here is an updated solution that finds the top three Elves carrying the most Calories, as well as their total number of Calories:

```python
# Read the input data
data = []
while True:
    try:
        line = input().strip()
        if line:
            data.append(int(line))
        else:
            data.append(None)
    except EOFError:
        break

# Find the Elves with the most calories
elf_calories = {}
current_elf = None
for calories in data:
    if calories is not None:
        elf_calories[current_elf] = elf_calories.get(current_elf, 0) + calories
    else:
        current_elf = len(elf_calories)

# Sort the Elves by their total number of calories, in descending order
sorted_elves = sorted(elf_calories.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Find the total number of calories carried by the top three Elves
top_3_calories = 0
for elf, calories in sorted_elves[:3]:
    top_3_calories += calories

# Print the result
print(top_3_calories)
```

This solution is similar to the previous one, with the addition of sorting the Elves by their total number of Calories and calculating the sum of the top three Elves.

To test this solution, you can run the following commands in a Python shell, using the same input data as before:

```python
# Set the input data
data = [1000, 2000, 3000, None, 4000, None, 5000, 6000, None, 7000, 8000, 9000, None, 10000]

# Find the Elves with the most calories
elf_calories = {}
current_elf = None
for calories in data:
    if calories is not None:
        elf_calories[current_elf] = elf_calories.get(current_elf, 0) + calories
    else:
        current_elf = len(elf_calories)

# Sort the Elves by their total number of calories, in descending order
sorted_elves = sorted(elf_calories.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

# Find the total number of calories carried by the top three Elves
top_3_calories = 0
for elf, calories in sorted_elves[:3]:
    top_3_calories += calories

# Print the result
print(top_3_calories)
```

This should print 45000, which is the correct answer for the example input provided in the problem description.
