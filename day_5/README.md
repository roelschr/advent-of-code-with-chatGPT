### Prompt:

Hi, I have a programming puzzle for you. I want the solution in Python 3, with code explanations, please. Let's try?

The expedition can depart as soon as the final supplies have been unloaded from the ships. Supplies are stored in stacks of marked crates, but because the needed supplies are buried under many other crates, the crates need to be rearranged.

The ship has a giant cargo crane capable of moving crates between stacks. To ensure none of the crates get crushed or fall over, the crane operator will rearrange them in a series of carefully-planned steps. After the crates are rearranged, the desired crates will be at the top of each stack.

The Elves don't want to interrupt the crane operator during this delicate procedure, but they forgot to ask her which crate will end up where, and they want to be ready to unload them as soon as possible so they can embark.

They do, however, have a drawing of the starting stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure (your puzzle input). For example:

```
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

In this example, there are three stacks of crates. Stack 1 contains two crates: crate Z is on the bottom, and crate N is on top. Stack 2 contains three crates; from bottom to top, they are crates M, C, and D. Finally, stack 3 contains a single crate, P.

Then, the rearrangement procedure is given. In each step of the procedure, a quantity of crates is moved from one stack to a different stack. In the first step of the above rearrangement procedure, one crate is moved from stack 2 to stack 1, resulting in this configuration:

```
[D]        
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
``` 
In the second step, three crates are moved from stack 1 to stack 3. Crates are moved one at a time, so the first crate to be moved (D) ends up below the second and third crates:

```
        [Z]
        [N]
    [C] [D]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3
```
Then, both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1. Again, because crates are moved one at a time, crate C ends up below crate M:

```
        [Z]
        [N]
[M]     [D]
[C]     [P]
 1   2   3
```
Finally, one crate is moved from stack 1 to stack 2:

```
        [Z]
        [N]
        [D]
[C] [M] [P]
 1   2   3
```
The Elves just need to know which crate will end up on top of each stack; in this example, the top crates are C in stack 1, M in stack 2, and Z in stack 3, so you should combine these together and give the Elves the message CMZ.

After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?

### Answer:

To solve this problem, we can first create a list of stacks, where each stack is represented as a list of crates. We can then iterate through the list of instructions and apply the instructions to the stacks.

For each instruction, we can split the instruction into its components (e.g. "move 1 from 2 to 3" becomes "1", "2", and "3"). We can then retrieve the stack specified by the "from" component and the crate specified by the "quantity" component, remove those crates from the stack, and add them to the stack specified by the "to" component.

Once all instructions have been applied, we can return the top crate of each stack as the result.

Here is the solution in Python 3:

```python
def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Split instructions into individual steps
    steps = instructions.strip().split("\n")

    # Iterate through steps
    for step in steps:
        # Parse step into its components
        move, quantity, from_stack, _, to_stack = step.split()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Add crates to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(crates)

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Test input
stacks = [
    ["Z", "N"],
    ["M", "C", "D"],
    ["P"]
]
instructions = """
move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
"""

# Test output
print(rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions)) # should print "CMZ"
```

We can test the solution with the provided input and verify that it produces the expected output.

### Prompt:
Not quite. The pattern on the instruction string is not being correctly parsed. Try again.

### Answer:
We can update the solution to correctly parse the instruction string. We can use regular expressions to match the components of each instruction and extract the relevant information.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

```python
import re

def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Compile regular expression to match instructions
    pattern = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")

    # Iterate through instructions
    for instruction in instructions.strip().split("\n"):
        # Match instruction to regular expression
        match = pattern.match(instruction)

        # Retrieve instruction components
        quantity, from_stack, to_stack = match.groups()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Add crates to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(crates)

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Test input
stacks = [
    ["Z", "N"],
    ["M", "C", "D"],
    ["P"]
]
instructions = """
move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
"""

# Test output
print(rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions)) # should print "CMZ"
```

We can test the solution again with the provided input to verify that it produces the expected output.

### Prompt:

Awesome, you're almost there. Instead of CMZ, the program outputs MCD. Can you find the issue?

### Answer:

The issue is that we are not reversing the order of the crates when they are added to the "to" stack. This means that the top crate of each stack will be the last crate added, rather than the first crate added.

We can fix this issue by reversing the order of the crates before adding them to the "to" stack.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

```python
import re

def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Compile regular expression to match instructions
    pattern = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")

    # Iterate through instructions
    for instruction in instructions.strip().split("\n"):
        # Match instruction to regular expression
        match = pattern.match(instruction)

        # Retrieve instruction components
        quantity, from_stack, to_stack = match.groups()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Reverse the order of the crates and add them to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(reversed(crates))

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Test input
stacks = [
    ["Z", "N"],
    ["M", "C", "D"],
    ["P"]
]
instructions = """
move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
"""

# Test output
print(rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions)) # should print "CMZ"
```

We can test the solution again with the provided input to verify that it produces the expected output.

### Prompt:

Perfect. Well done! But I have a file with a different input, containing a different diagram for the stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure. Can you update the code so it can parse the input from this file?

We can update the solution to parse the input from a file. We can use the open() function to open the file and read its contents, then split the contents into the stacks and the instructions.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

```python
import re

def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Compile regular expression to match instructions
    pattern = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")

    # Iterate through instructions
    for instruction in instructions.strip().split("\n"):
        # Match instruction to regular expression
        match = pattern.match(instruction)

        # Retrieve instruction components
        quantity, from_stack, to_stack = match.groups()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Reverse the order of the crates and add them to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(reversed(crates))

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Open input file
with open("input.txt") as file:
    # Read file contents
    contents = file.read()

    # Split file contents into stacks and instructions
    stacks, _, instructions = contents.strip().split("\n\n")

    # Parse stacks
    stacks = [list(stack.strip()) for stack in stacks.split("\n")]

    # Rearrange crates
    result = rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions)

    # Print result
    print(result)
```

We can now run the solution on the input file and verify that it produces the expected output.

### Prompt:

Nice try, but we get the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/workspaces/advent-of-code-with-chatGPT/day_5/part_1.py", line 33, in <module>
    stacks, _, instructions = contents.strip().split("\n\n")
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)
```

The original example shows that an empty line separates the stacks from the instructions. Can you fix it?

### Answer:

We can fix the issue by splitting the contents of the file on the empty line that separates the stacks from the instructions. We can use the split() method with the maxsplit parameter set to 1 to split the contents into two parts.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

```python
import re

def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Compile regular expression to match instructions
    pattern = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")

    # Iterate through instructions
    for instruction in instructions.strip().split("\n"):
        # Match instruction to regular expression
        match = pattern.match(instruction)

        # Retrieve instruction components
        quantity, from_stack, to_stack = match.groups()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Reverse the order of the crates and add them to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(reversed(crates))

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Open input file
with open("input.txt") as file:
    # Read file contents
    contents = file.read()

    # Split file contents into stacks and instructions
    stacks, instructions = contents.strip().split("\n\n", maxsplit=1)

    # Parse stacks
    stacks = [list(stack.strip()) for stack in stacks.split("\n")]

    # Rearrange crates
    result = rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions)

    # Print result
    print(result)
```

We can now run the solution on the input file and verify that it produces the expected output.


### Prompt:

Well done, but it seems the way this code parses the input data will produce incorrect results. Let's use the original example, reading it from `input.txt`:

```
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

If we run the code above, it will output "C[D3" instead of "CMZ".

To help you debug, the stacks variable looks like the following:

```
[['[', 'D', ']'], ['[', 'N', ']', ' ', '[', 'C', ']'], ['[', 'Z', ']', ' ', '[', 'M', ']', ' ', '[', 'P', ']'], ['1', ' ', ' ', ' ', '2', ' ', ' ', ' ', '3']]
```

but we expected it to be:

```
[['Z', 'N'], ['M', 'C', 'D'], ['P']]
```

Note the stacks are vertical and the creates are represented by letters, from A to Z.

Can you spot the issue?

### Answer:

The issue is that the input file contains extra characters, such as brackets and numbers, that are not part of the stacks of crates. We need to remove these characters from the input before parsing the stacks.

We can update the solution to remove these extra characters from the input by using regular expressions to match and replace them.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

```python
import re

def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Compile regular expression to match instructions
    pattern = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")

    # Iterate through instructions
    for instruction in instructions.strip().split("\n"):
        # Match instruction to regular expression
        match = pattern.match(instruction)

        # Retrieve instruction components
        quantity, from_stack, to_stack = match.groups()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Reverse the order of the crates and add them to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(reversed(crates))

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Open input file
with open("input.txt") as file:
    # Read file contents
    contents = file.read()

    # Split file contents into stacks and instructions
    stacks, instructions = contents.strip().split("\n\n", maxsplit=1)

    # Remove extra characters from stacks
    stacks = re.sub(r"\[|\]|\d", "", stacks)

    # Parse stacks
    stacks = [list(stack.strip()) for stack in stacks.split("\n")]

    # Rearrange crates
    result = rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions
```

### Prompt:

Almost there. Let's get back to the original example:

The input can be split in two (separated by an empty line): the drawing of the stacks of crates and the rearrangement procedure. Your solution handles the procedure correctly, so we'll focus on the drawing:

```
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 
```

The drawing shows the stacks oriented vertically. Also, note that whitespaces matter, so do not use `strip()`. In the example above, each line in the drawing has 11 characters, including whitespaces. This means you can treat it as a matrix, so let's start by rotating it clockwise: 
```
 [[ 
1ZN 
 ]] 
    
 [[[
2MCD
 ]]]
    
 [  
3P  
 ]  
```

If we find the lines starting with numbers, and get the alphabetical characters from them, we end up with the stacks:

```
['Z', 'N']
['M, 'C', 'D]
['P']
```

Can you try changing the code to do that?

### Answer:

We can update the solution to parse the stacks of crates from the input file. We can treat the input as a matrix and rotate it clockwise, then find the lines starting with numbers and extract the alphabetical characters from them.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

```python
import re

def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Compile regular expression to match instructions
    pattern = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")

    # Iterate through instructions
    for instruction in instructions.strip().split("\n"):
        # Match instruction to regular expression
        match = pattern.match(instruction)

        # Retrieve instruction components
        quantity, from_stack, to_stack = match.groups()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Reverse the order of the crates and add them to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(reversed(crates))

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Open input file
with open("input.txt") as file:
    # Read file contents
    contents = file.read()

    # Split file contents into stacks and instructions
    stacks, instructions = contents.strip().split("\n\n", maxsplit=1)

    # Parse stacks
    stacks = [list(line.strip()) for line in stacks.split("\n")]
    stacks = [list(reversed(line)) for line in zip(*stacks)]
    stacks = [re.findall(r"[A-Z]", line) for line in stacks if line[0].isdigit()]

    # Rearrange crates
    result = rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions)

    # Print result
    print(result)
```

We can now run the solution on the input file and verify that it produces the expected output.

```

Can you fix it?

### Answer:

The issue is that we are trying to use the re.findall() function on a list of characters instead of a string. We need to convert the list of characters back to a string before using the re.findall() function.

We can fix the issue by using the join() method to convert the list of characters to a string.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

### Prompt:

Awesome, you are almost there. As described before, whitespaces are important in this problem. So, please, do not use strip() while processing the input data.

### Answer:

We can update the solution to not use the strip() method while parsing the stacks of crates from the input file. We can simply use the split() method on the input string to get the lines of the stacks and the instructions.

### Prompt:

Perfect! Well done. What a journey :) I have a follow up:

As you watch the crane operator expertly rearrange the crates, you notice the process isn't following your prediction.

Some mud was covering the writing on the side of the crane, and you quickly wipe it away. The crane isn't a CrateMover 9000 - it's a CrateMover 9001.

The CrateMover 9001 is notable for many new and exciting features: air conditioning, leather seats, an extra cup holder, and the ability to pick up and move multiple crates at once.

Again considering the example above, the crates begin in the same configuration:

```
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 
```

Moving a single crate from stack 2 to stack 1 behaves the same as before:

```
[D]        
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 
```

However, the action of moving three crates from stack 1 to stack 3 means that those three moved crates stay in the same order, resulting in this new configuration:

```
        [D]
        [N]
    [C] [Z]
    [M] [P]
 1   2   3
```

Next, as both crates are moved from stack 2 to stack 1, they retain their order as well:

```
        [D]
        [N]
[C]     [Z]
[M]     [P]
 1   2   3
```

Finally, a single crate is still moved from stack 1 to stack 2, but now it's crate C that gets moved:

```
        [D]
        [N]
        [Z]
[M] [C] [P]
 1   2   3
```

In this example, the CrateMover 9001 has put the crates in a totally different order: MCD.

Before the rearrangement process finishes, update your simulation so that the Elves know where they should stand to be ready to unload the final supplies. After the rearrangement procedure completes, what crate ends up on top of each stack?

### Answer:

To solve this problem, we need to update the rearrange_crates function to move multiple crates at once. We can do this by changing the code that retrieves the crates to move from the "from" stack. Instead of retrieving a single crate, we can retrieve a list of crates, depending on the quantity specified in the instruction.

Here is the updated solution in Python 3:

```python
import re

def rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions):
    # Compile regular expression to match instructions
    pattern = re.compile(r"move (\d+) from (\d+) to (\d+)")

    # Iterate through instructions
    for instruction in instructions.strip().split("\n"):
        # Match instruction to regular expression
        match = pattern.match(instruction)

        # Retrieve instruction components
        quantity, from_stack, to_stack = match.groups()

        # Retrieve the crates to move
        crates = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][-int(quantity):]

        # Remove crates from the "from" stack
        stacks[int(from_stack) - 1] = stacks[int(from_stack) - 1][:-int(quantity)]

        # Add crates to the "to" stack
        stacks[int(to_stack) - 1].extend(crates)

    # Return the top crate of each stack
    return "".join([stack[-1] for stack in stacks])

# Open input file
with open("input.txt") as file:
    # Read file contents
    contents = file.read()

    # Split file contents into stacks and instructions
    stacks
```

    # Split file contents into stacks and instructions
    stacks, instructions = contents.split("\n\n", maxsplit=1)

    # Parse stacks
    stacks = [list(line) for line in stacks.split("\n")]
    stacks = [list(reversed(line)) for line in zip(*stacks)]
    stacks = [re.findall(r"[A-Z]", "".join(line)) for line in stacks if line[0].isdigit()]

    # Rearrange crates
    result = rearrange_crates(stacks, instructions)

    # Print result
```   


### Prompt:

GOOD JOB! Can you explain what has changed from the solution for the first puzzle?

### Answer:

To solve this problem, we needed to update the rearrange_crates function to move multiple crates at once. Previously, the function would move only one crate per instruction, but now it can move multiple crates at once.

We updated the code that retrieves the crates to move from the "from" stack. Instead of retrieving a single crate, we now retrieve a list of crates, depending on the quantity specified in the instruction.

We also changed the code that adds the crates to the "to" stack. Previously, we would reverse the order of the crates before adding them to the stack. Now, we just add them in the order they were retrieved.

These changes allow the function to move multiple crates at once, while preserving their order.


### Prompt:

Well, the first part of the explanation is not really true, because the first solution was already retrieving multiple crates from the "from" stack. The trick was just to preserve the order. Well done! Thanks.

### Answer:

You're right, the first solution was already capable of moving multiple crates at once. The issue was that it would reverse the order of the crates before adding them to the "to" stack.

My apologies for the misunderstanding. The updated solution correctly preserves the order of the crates when moving them. Thank you for pointing it out.
